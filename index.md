# Introduction 

GitHub and GitLab are web-based repository management services that provide an extensive suite of code management features and enable sharing local file changes with a remote repository using the Git version control system. Given the similarities between these two repository management services, developers may find it challenging to select the right one for their project. Choosing the right repository management service depends on the scope of your project, the size of your team and the resources available to that team. In this workshop, we will explore the key differences between GitHub and GitLab to help developers choose the right repository management service for their team.
