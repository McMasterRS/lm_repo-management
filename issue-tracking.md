# Issue Tracking

Both platforms offer a built-in issue tracker that allows developers to keep track of the features and bug fixes that are currently in development. GitHub and GitLabâ€™s issue trackers offer similar features that include labels (for identifying the type/release window of an issue), milestones, assignees, detailed descriptions, etc. Both platforms offer an aggregate view of the issues that are currently open. This feature is particularly useful for team leads or project managers. The GitLab issue tracker is more visually appealing and informative according to some developers, although it often comes down to personal preference. In a nutshell, both platforms offer similarly capable issue trackers, so this area will likely not be a crucial factor when deciding which platform to opt for.
