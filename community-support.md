# Community Support

Both platforms have rapidly growing communities of developers that are actively using and supporting them. Nevertheless, the GitHub community is considerably larger than the GitLab one with more than 372 million repositories being hosted on GitHub. According to the programming tools company JetBrains, 77% of developers use GitHub regularly using their IDEs compared to 40% for GitLab and 25% for BitBucket. GitHubâ€™s popularity may in part be due to the fact it launched 3 years prior to GitLab. If public accessibility is a requirement for your project, GitHub may be the platform of choice since it will allow your project to reach a larger audience that may be interested in contributing to its development.
