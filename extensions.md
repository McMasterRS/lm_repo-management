# Extensions

GitHub and GitLab support integrations with additional software development and communication tools like Asana, Jira, MS Teams, Slack, and others. Since GitLab is focused on being a complete packaged DevOps platform, the number of extensions on its marketplace is considerably smaller than the GitHub counterpart. However, it is important to keep in mind that a lot of the extensions available on the GitHub marketplace simply replicate functionality that is already included in GitLab (particularly in the CI/CD department). For instance, GitLab includes native time tracking support, whereas this feature requires a third-party marketplace app on GitHub. Moreover, some GitHub extensions are paid, which means the team may have to incur additional costs to use these features. If your team is already using a particular software development or DevOps tool, it may be worthwhile to check if there is an extension that allows you to connect this tool to GitHub/GitLab before settling on a platform.
