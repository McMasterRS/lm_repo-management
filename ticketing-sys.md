## What is a Ticketing System?

A ticketing system is a software designed to organize and distribute customer service requests. In the context of a software development team, a ticketing system allows developers to easily communicate with customers regarding bug reports and feature or support requests. A ticket system can easily alert developers when customers encounter an issue or if they require additional features or functionality. Tickets also keep a history of all communications between the developers and users, thus making it easier to go back to an old issue by re-opening an existing ticket that already has all the relevant information in it. A ticketing system can also be used by the developers internally to report bugs or highlight features to be added to their software in addition to effectively distributing the workload among the different members of the team and managing releases. A ticketing system also helps developers structure their pull or merge requests since most tickets end up being addressed via code modifications that are merged to the main branch using a merge/pull request. As a matter of fact, many popular ticketing systems like Jira can be integrated into a repository management system like GitHub or GitLab to facilitate the creation of merge/pull requests from tickets.
