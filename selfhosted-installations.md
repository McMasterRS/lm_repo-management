# Self-hosted Installations

One of the main advantages of GitLab is that it allows teams to host a private version of GitLab on their servers. This gives the team a greater deal of control over the platform and allows them to optimize their workflow by configuring platform update times and having more granular control over access to their projects. GitHub also supports hosting a private instance of the repository management system, but this feature is limited to the enterprise plan unlike GitLab which offers this ability in the free tier. Hosting a private instance is also more common in GitLab, so you may be able to find more resources on this topic in the GitLab online community.
