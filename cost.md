# Cost

GitLab is marketed as a complete feature-packed DevOps platform that reduces the need for additional software management tools. As such, its paid plans are more expensive than their GitHub counterparts. Both platforms offer a free plan, a mid-tier paid plan (GitHub Team vs. GitLab Premium), and a top tier paid plan (GitHub Enterprise vs. GitLab Ultimate). Both platforms offer the option to buy additional add-ons in the form of compute credits or storage space. When comparing costs between these platforms, it is important to account for the costs of any additional paid extensions that GitHub may require to match the GitLab feature set. Some basic features in GitHub like the ability to search for repositories inside your organization are reserved for the paid plans. GitHub may be sufficient for smaller teams with small to medium sized projects looking to cut operation costs. Larger teams that require a full DevOps solution may find GitLab’s all-in-one approach to repository and project management more appealing.
