# Summary

GitHub and GitLab are web-based repository management services that offer a plethora of features to help developers collaborate and manage complex code repositories. Choosing the right repository management platform for your team and project can be difficult and time-consuming. GitLab’s main selling point is its ability to act as a complete DevOps platform that facilitates project creation and management from the planning phase to the deployment phase without the need to incur the costs of additional third-party tools and with a workflow that prioritizes stability. GitLab’s CI/CD features are well ahead of the competition, thus making it the go-to platform for any project or team that requires a vast suite of CI/CD tools. On the other hand, GitHub focuses on speed and simplicity with its workflow and enjoys the support of a larger community, which allows your project to reach a wider audience. GitHub has rudimentary support for CI tools in the form of GitHub Actions but requires using third-party tools for more advanced CI/CD operations. Both platforms offer feature-rich issue trackers. Ultimately, choosing the right repository management software will depend on the type, size, and scope of your project. Smaller teams may find GitHub’s lower cost to entry more attractive whereas larger teams will probably find value in the GitLab’s well-rounded feature set.
